The Isabelle theories in this package provide a formal development of
some essential elements of the theory of omega-automata, i.e. finite
automata that operate on infinite words, in the proof assistant
Isabelle/HOL.

- Preliminaries.thy: miscellaneous lemmas about HOL structures that
  could at some point be integrated in the appropriate HOL theory.

- Words.thy: (finite and) infinite words, and various operations on
  them such as concatenation and omega-iteration.

- Dags.thy: a formalization of omega-dags, used to represent run dags
  of omega-automata.

- NDTable.thy: non-deterministic transition systems, their (finite and
  infinite) executions and run dags.

- Buchi.thy: Buchi automata, their languages, closure under union.

- GBuchi.thy: generalized Buchi automata, closure under intersection
  (for ordinary and generalized Buchi automata), simulation between
  ordinary and generalized Buchi automata.

- BuchiComplement.thy: complementation of Buchi automata, via the
  Kupferman-Vardi proof.

The development relies on the theories Infinite_Set and Parity that
are part of the Isabelle distribution (inside HOL/Library), but not
included in HOL/Main.thy.

Use a command such as 

  isatool usedir -d pdf -s Automata HOL isa-automata

(from the parent directory) to produce a human-readable document from
these theories. Assuming default settings, the document will appear in
~/isabelle/browser_info/HOL/Automata.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectory WAA contains an older development of weak alternating
automata (including closure under complementation and their link with
propositional temporal logic), which could eventually be integrated
into the development of the main theories.
