  abstract  = {An algorithm is given for minimizing the number of states in a finite automaton or for determining if two finite automata are equivalent. The asymptotic running time of the algorithm is bounded by k n log n where k is some constant and n is the number of states. The constant k depends linearly on the size of the input alphabet.}
