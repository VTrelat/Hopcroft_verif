# Verification in Isabelle/HOL of Hopcroft's algorithm for minimizing DFAs including runtime analysis

Research project supervised by [Prof. Dr. Tobias Nipkow](https://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/), based on previous work of [Dr. Peter Lammich](https://www21.in.tum.de/~lammich/).

The main theory is in [Hopcroft_Minimisation.thy](./Automata_Malik_Tuerk/Hopcroft_Minimisation.thy).

The biweekly progress report is in [Progress_Reports](./Progress_Reports.md).
