# Verification in Isabelle/HOL of Hopcroft's algorithm for minimizing DFAs including runtime analysis

Research project supervised by [Tobias Nipkow](https://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/), based on previous work of [Peter Lammich](https://www21.in.tum.de/~lammich/) and [Thomas TÃ¼rk](https://www.thomas-tuerk.de/).

The main theory is in [Hopcroft_Minimisation.thy](./Automata_Malik_Tuerk/Hopcroft_Minimisation.thy).

A biweekly progress report can be found in [Progress_Report](./Progress_Report.md).
